1. **What is Python?**
   Python is a computer language that lets you give instructions to a computer. It's like writing a recipe for the computer to follow. It's easy to read and write, making it great for beginners.

2. **Why is Python popular and useful?**
   Python is popular because it's simple to use and very powerful. It can be used for many things like making games, analyzing data, and building websites. It's like a Swiss Army knife for computer programming!

3. **Understanding variables and data types (integers, strings).**
   In Python, variables are like labeled jars where you store information. Data types are the kind of information you can store, like numbers (integers) and text (strings). For example, `age = 12` stores an integer, and `name = "Alex"` stores a string.

4. **Introducing the concept of a list.**
   A list in Python is like a shopping list. It's a collection of items in a particular order. You can add, remove, or find items in it. For example, `fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]` is a list of fruits.

5. **What are conditional statements (`if`, `else`).**
   Conditional statements in Python are like a game of "if this, then that." They help the computer make decisions. If a condition is true, the computer does one thing; if not, it can do something else. Like, "if it's raining, take an umbrella, else wear sunglasses."
