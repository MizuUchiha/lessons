# Python Programming Lessons by Angelika Klimek

## Introduction
This repository contains a series of interactive lessons aimed at teaching Python programming. Designed for beginners, these lessons cover everything from setting up the environment to building simple projects.

## Repository Structure
Each lesson is in its own directory, named numerically (e.g., "01" for Lesson 01). Inside each directory, you'll find:
- `plan.md`: The lesson plan.
- `examples/`: Introductory code examples.
- `snippets/`: Code snippets for the lesson.

## How to Use
Navigate to the lesson directory you wish to start with, and follow the `plan.md` for a guided learning experience. Experiment with the code examples and snippets to reinforce your understanding.
### Lessons
- [Lesson 01](01/plan.md)

## Target Audience
This repository is intended for individuals new to programming or those starting their journey with Python.

## Prerequisites

No prior programming experience is required to benefit from these lessons, making them suitable for beginners. However, a basic understanding of computers and software will be helpful.

Additionally, to run any of the provided code snippets, you will need to have Python installed on your machine. You can download and install Python from the official website: [Install Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
